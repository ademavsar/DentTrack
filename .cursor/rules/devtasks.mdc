# Project Rules

As a developer, you must follow these instructions precisely. All tasks and progress should be managed within the `DEV_TASKS.md` file only.

- All tasks should be clearly marked with checkboxes.
- Once a task is complete, tick the corresponding box.
- If a task raises any uncertainty or requires clarification, do not proceed. Instead, insert a `> ⚠️` callout below the relevant task with a brief note.
- Do not provide external summaries or explanations. All notes must stay within the file.
- If the next task is listed and unchecked, proceed to that task automatically after completing the current one.
- You are not expected to provide additional messages unless explicitly asked via the file.

<!-- Preferred Workflow: file-driven -->
